# TensorFlow Programs for practice
Following repo is collection of tensorflow codes with different datasets. These programs can help for the preparation of TensorFlow Developer Certification Exam. The repo is divided into 4 parts according to structure of the exam. Programs are from basic to advance. There are some custom datasets and links for these datasets is given below. The programs are divided into 
1. Tensorflow Deep Neural Network programs(TF_DNN)
2. Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network programs (TF_CNN) 
3. Tensorflow Natural Language Processing programs(TF_NLP)
4. Tensorflow Time Series (TF_Sequence)

Hope you find this repo useful
