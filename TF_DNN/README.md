# Tensorflow Neural Network Programs
Deep Neural Networks can be used for various classification and regression tasks. They are also used for image processing , natural language processing and time series tasks. Tensorflow provides easier way to create neural networks.

#### Following are the two programs:
1. Basic regression program with a single dense layer
2. Credit classification program for classifying credit worthiness by using 30 different features
